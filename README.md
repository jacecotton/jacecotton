Hey there! Welcome to the open source repo for my personal portfolio website (https://jacecotton.com/, or for now, http://jacecotton.herokuapp.com/).

# Tech stuff
This project is a simple Node.js app running on Express.js (server framework) and Nunjucks.js (template engine). I use Gulp.js as a taskrunner/build tool which handles all my pre- and post-processing (SASS, Autoprefixer, Uglify, image optimization, etc.)

# Setting up
Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start Gulp:

```bash
$ gulp watch
```

Start server:

```bash
$ npm run watch
```
