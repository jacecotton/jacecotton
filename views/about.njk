  <h2 class="heading">More about me</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Hi, there! I'm a web developer from Houston, TX. I mostly consider myself to be a front-end specialist, dealing with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create dynamic, responsive web interfaces. I've been self-taught since 2011, though I also completed associates coursework in 2019.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    I have a passion for the web's blend of technical and creative challenges, demanding both analytical and artistic approaches to problem-solving. This started as a hobby, making simple sites for friends and family until I developed a knack for it that turned into a career choice.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    I've since had the opportunity to work with clients in healthcare, construction, manufacturing, and other sectors. I am currently represented by Creative Circle.
